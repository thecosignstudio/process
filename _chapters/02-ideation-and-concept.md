# Ideation and Concept

## Introduction
**In this section, you will learn:**
* 什麼是發想以及何時該執行
* 如何向客戶解釋發想的重要性
* 發想的組成
* 一個概念的組成
* 在發想及概念的流程上該花多久的時間
* 那些最常被客戶問到的問題

發想及概念階段是設計流程中最基礎的，正是取得主要需求共識以及決定日後發展大方向的時間點，同時是將最初的想法轉變成基本草案/原型的時刻。設計流程最主要的目標不僅是創造漂亮的圖像或是去滿足各個利害關係人主觀的感受 - 最主要的目標是交出一個容易理解、使用方便且引人注意的產品，使客戶的企業目標與用戶目標相符合。我們希望做的產品不僅好看，更重要的是它也需要好用且完美的滿足（甚至超越）使用者的期待。

In order to deliver a great product, much effort needs to be taken, and Ideation & Concept marks the first major milestone in this process. This is the stage where many questions will arise, and conducting thorough research will help answer most of them early and will also bring benefits in the latter stages. Not only will research save us time, but it will also give the Product Design team a deep insight into and a better understanding of the product specifics. The client, on the other hand, will benefit from the research too, because challenging a client with the right questions helps them crystallize their vision and may lead to some substantial changes.

#### Benefits: why is it a good idea to do ideation together as a team?
When doing the ideation & concept phase together, a team can generate ideas faster and verify their ideas in the context of the product. Working in a group also gives you a chance to use the so-called mutual design critique (when one designer contests the ideas of another designer). This technique will allow you to see drawbacks in your thinking process and bring you visual inspirations from others.

## What are the benefits of Ideation & Concept?
**Benefits for people who will use the product:**
- Value proposition of the product has been considered
- The product is based on hypotheses and assumptions that have been verified with users; thus, users will be more satisfied with the solution
- The product is not based on one idea but on an analysis of many possible solutions

**產品設計師的效益：**
- 你能為未來的設計流程奠定強而有力的基礎
- 你無需在設計階段浪費時間為專案的線框圖尋找適合的外觀
- 概念提案的版面是為了在設計後期階段和客戶溝通風格、視覺等事項。例如：如果客戶試圖變更之前的合約，你可以向客戶提出先前同意的內容。
- 客戶對你的信任 — 具說服力的概念和構想階段是奠定雙方良好關係的基礎，因為你證明你了解他們的產品。
- 對於產品的市場、文化和用戶脈絡有更宏觀的願景。
- 除此之外，視覺概念有助於你可以更容易地理解用戶，並透過收集和建立假設與客戶和最終用戶進行驗證。

**Benefits for the client:**
- A solid ideation phase raises the chances of the product’s success because the whole development process is built upon solid data about the market, culture, and competitors.
- The concept helps the client get a new perspective on their product.
- The client can see how the product fits the market.
- At the beginning of the design stage, the client will know the whole spectrum of possible solutions and will be able to find the best one.
- The client can share the results of your work internally and externally (for example, with investors).
- A better understanding of the market.
- Review of direct competitors: their flaws and merits.
- An insight into the potential obstacles and pitfalls that they should avoid.
- Information about end users’ expectations.
- An informed competitive advantage.
- The wireframing phase will be easier and faster to conduct (recommendations, etc.).

**Stakeholders**
- Designers
- Clients
- Quality Assurance specialist (QA specialist)
- Project Manager (PM)

## Ideation Phase
At this point in the Product Design Process, you will have already gone through a Strategic Analysis phase, where you will have conducted extensive Workshops, Desk Research, and User Research. At Netguru, we use a [UX Review](https://www.netguru.co/services/ux-review/){:target="_blank"} and a [Product Design Sprint](https://www.netguru.co/services/product-design-sprint/){:target="_blank"} for these purposes. With a proper [UX Review](https://www.netguru.co/services/ux-review/){:target="_blank"}, you can create an information architecture draft and user flows, define user personas (LINK), and develop a report based on a data analysis. A [Product Design Sprint](https://www.netguru.co/services/product-design-sprint/){:target="_blank"} allows you to validate the fundamental product assumptions and build the first versions of the product roadmap and user stories. In the following sections, you will learn what to do to conduct successful ideation.

### The elements of the ideation phase:
- Literature review (collecting and reviewing all existing materials relevant to your subject, e.g., academic articles, Google search).
- Collecting detailed information (existing materials, corporate guidelines) about your client’s business and the services the client offers
- Information on the target customer base (What do they want, need, and expect?)
- Analysis of competitors (Who are they? How are they different? How are they similar? How do they advertise or make information available?)
- Analysis of current or future user behaviors
- Analysis of the outcomes of workshops and the research

### Things to consider:
- Do you need to run a full design audit? Much like a SWOT analysis, which assesses strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, a design audit applies the same stringent methodology to analyzing the competitors’ visual presence in the marketplace

{% include quote.html text="A graphic design audit is a fantastic and relatively easy way to get a clear picture of how your competitors are perceived, what key messages they are communicating and how you look when placed alongside them. It’s also a valuable exercise that informs you about the type of communication your customers are receiving on a regular basis from your key competitors." author="Clare, 2006e" %}

- What are the implications of the audience profile in relation to the project goals?
- What are the most appropriate means of communicating with this audience (i.e., what media and marketing tools should you use)?
- How do the goals of this project align with your client’s long-term goals?
- Is your client’s message what actually needs to be communicated in order to further the client’s business goals?

Research takes time and can cost money, but in the grand scheme of things, it will save time and money by helping to focus the direction of the design process. It also helps you justify to your client the communication solutions you put forward. **Remember that all research must be carefully documented, and information sources need to be saved and made available for future reference.**

### What is the product?
- What is your product’s value proposition?
- What is your desired competitive advantage?
- What sets your product/feature apart from the competitors?
- What is the main selling point?
- What is the client’s idea/vision of the product?
- Web & mobile?
- Are other touchpoints relevant to the client?
- Do you have any benchmarks and inspirations in mind?
- How do you educate your users? (Onboarding, Content, etc.)
- What is the most important feature of the product?
- What is the primary goal of the product?
- What is the primary action in the product?
- What is the primary information that product provides?

### Business goals are the most important from the client’s perspective
One of the most important aspects of design for both parties is to understand the goals of the product you are designing. Ask the client:
- What are the business goals that you want to accomplish?
- What is your business model?
- Are you making any money?
- Do you have an investor or are you bootstrapping?
- Have you conducted market research?
- Do you have a market niche?

#### Business model
- How do you want to fund your business in the future?
- Business strategy
    - Do you have one?
    - Desired pricing model?
    - Market strategy?
    - Digital marketing?
    - Content strategy?
    - Offline strategy?
- Digital strategy
    - How do you speak about your product online?
    - Success stories, case studies.
    - Strategies per product?
    - Do you have a cross-platform promotion strategy?
    - Are you planning an international expansion?
- How would you like to be perceived as a brand?
- How should your users perceive you as a company? (e.g., innovative, traditional, easy to use)?

#### Business goal
- What is the main short-term business objective?
- What are the KPIs you’d like to achieve?

#### Market
- How is your brand unique and how does it differ from the competition? Why should people choose your brand and use your app?
- How do you drive traffic / reach market groups?
        - How do you track the results of your marketing efforts?
        - Where are you trying to market groups?
        - What are your promotion channels? Do you have a strategy?
- Questions about the competitors:
    - Who are they?
    - How are they different?
    - How are they similar?
    - How do they advertise or make information available?
    - Estimates and technical advice from subcontractors (e.g., printers)
- Are there any similar product offerings or alternative solutions to the same problem?  What are your potential customers doing today instead of using your future product?
- Are there any ideas already on the market that you would like to implement?
- Business critical features?
- Your Partners’ perspective:
    - What do they need?
    - Turning for customer sales people
    - Division of responsibilities
- Other requirements / legal restrictions
- What country (or region) is the product to be launched in?
- What is the language the product is to be designed in?
- Are there any special requirements regarding the market that should be taken into consideration (e.g., limitations related to the culture or religion)?
- Is the product limited by regional law anyhow (for example anti-spam regulations or copyright)?
- Is the product to be regionally diversified (e.g., different language versions)?

Sometimes, very direct questions won’t work the way we want.
- Be smart during the interview with your client and ask them about the things that seem to be vital to them.
- Maybe there is a problem that we can solve and measure?
- Be sure to set clear goals for what you want to achieve.
- It’s highly recommended that you review the [Business Model Canvas.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Business_Model_Canvas.png){:target="_blank"} It’s not a clear example of which questions to ask, but it shows the fundamental aspects of business and products. You can treat it as an inspiration for collecting your thoughts.

Since everything is trackable, speak about the exact points you’re going to track. Identify the client’s KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). Good KPIs take into account the business context, predict success, show early warning signals, and validate the achieved results. You can use the following materials to create [tailor-made KPI materials.](http://www.bscdesigner.com/kpi-system-example.htm){:target="_blank"} They could range from new sign-ups to some customers using Paypal vs. purchases with credit cards. Always make sure you know how high you’re aiming from the start. Sometimes, it can be challenging to analyze.

### Define users/target customer base
Regardless of what you design, it is absolutely mandatory to figure out whom you are targeting. Many of us believe that our product is for everyone, but trying to make your product appeal to everyone is going to be painful and expensive. What you want to do is figure out specifically whom you are targeting and focus your efforts on specifically on this niche. Finding out more about your target customer base will boost your effectiveness and eventually improve your reach because once you know who your users are, you’ll know how to design for them.

- Who are the users of your site? (primary and secondary users)
    - How would you describe the users? (user characteristics such as age, experience, education, etc.)
    - Why will they visit the site? (user needs, interests, and goals)
    - When and where will the users access the site? (user environment and context)
    - How will the users access the site? (user hardware settings such as connection speed, resolution, etc.)
- Do you have or are aware of user personas?
- If personas are not provided, take a note of it and create personas.
- Have you gathered any user feedback?

### Define users’ goals
For a better understanding of your users’ needs and goals, we can use [job stories](https://blog.intercom.com/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/){:target="_blank"}. Based on our own empathy and this method, we can discover what users really need and what actions they have to take to achieve their goals. By knowing this, we can build a better [customer journey map](http://boxesandarrows.com/an-introduction-to-user-journeys/){:target="_blank"} that allows users to achieve their goals more quickly.

Answer questions below to define better users goals:

- What are the user [stories?](https://www.netguru.co/blog/doing-features-and-user-stories-the){:target="_blank"}
- What are users’ [jobs to be done?](https://blog.intercom.com/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/){:target="_blank"}
- What will users do on the site? (user tasks, content, features, and functionality)
- Which tasks are critical to users’ success on the website? (criticality)
- Which tasks are most important to users? (importance)
- Which features of the site will users use most? (frequency)
- Which features are prone to usability issues? (vulnerability)
- Which tasks are critical to the organization’s success on the website?
- What is the user retention on your website?
- What will make users return to your website?
- What kind of disabilities might your users have?
    - Do they need assistive features?
    - Are there any alternative methods that we can use to deliver the same content?
- Did client run user research?
- How do you track users’ behavior?
- What do the users want?
- What do the users need?
- What are the users’ expectations?
- JPG (jobs, pains, gains)
- How do you educate your users about your products and their value?
- Who’s your ideal user and what is the typical flow performed by that user in the app/website, etc.?
- Statistics (if they exist):
    - How many people use your product every day?
    - How many people download the app monthly


### Define the competitors
For UX designers, evaluating the competition involves looking at the designs of products that are both in direct and indirect competition. Products that **directly compete** with each other are looking to solve the same problem. They often offer the same core functionalities and have an overlapping user base. **Indirect competitors** either have a different user base or a different service offering, while some aspects of the products overlap.

Answer the following questions to define the competition better:

- Have you benchmarked against your main competitors recently?
- What is your competitor’s mission (if it exists)?
- What are the products/services offered (with pricing)?
- What are the competitor’s strengths? What is the competitor good at?
- What are the competitor’s weaknesses? Where does the competitor fall short?
- What are the key brand differentiators? What are the messaging, product/service offerings, etc., that set the competitor apart from their competition?
- What do we share? What are the competitor’s must-haves/must-avoids?

## Concept
### Definition
Concept is the visual and verbal summary of the research process. At this stage of the design process, you’re making a synthesis of everything that you have found about the project: the competition, goals, etc. The result of this stage is a potential visual direction formed into a concept.

### What is the goal of making the concept for your project?
The Research and Concept stages are closely related to each other. The concept helps clarify the information found during the research and put it into a logical order. Thanks to this, you will easily determine rough guidelines for the style and form of your project. As a result, it will save you time during the next stages of the design process.

### Setup Project Folder and Start Collecting Moodboards
There are plenty of sites you can use for inspiration: [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Behance](https://www.behance.net/){:target="_blank"}, [Pttrns](https://pttrns.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Pinterest](https://pl.pinterest.com/){:target="_blank"}, etc. It’s really easy to find similar projects to the one you will be working on. Additionally, there may already exist a UI solution to a problem you’re experiencing and trying to solve.
You can save everything you have found on the Internet to an Inspirations folder to be able to use it later to create basic moodboards. This folder could be filled with anything: plugins, swatches, or even full case studies from Behance. You can use InVision Moodboards, which is a perfect tool for collecting and sharing inspiration within the team.

### Generating Ideas and Concepts from Concept Mapping
You can use the information in a concept map to generate additional concepts for your project by reorganizing the items on the map.
- Position your design problem as the central idea of your mind map.
- Place circles containing your initial concepts for solving the problem around the central topic.
- Brainstorm related but non-specific concepts and add them as subtopics of these ideas. All related concepts are relevant. At this stage, every conceivable concept is valuable and should not be judged.
- Generate related ideas for each concept you brainstormed in step 3 and add them as subtopics.
- Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you run out of ideas.

### Applying Rhetorical Devices to Concept Mapping
After you have placed all your ideas on the concept map, you can add additional layering to help you refine and explore them further. For example, you can use rhetorical devices to add context to the concepts and make them come alive. Rhetoric is the study of effective communication through the use of the art of persuasion. Design uses many forms of rhetoric, metaphor in particular. If you apply a metaphor-based approach to each idea in your concept map, you will find many new ways to express your message.

### What should the concept include?
#### Verbal (text):
- Executive Summary of the research (short assumptions, disclaimers)
- Suggested tone and voice (if the client’s product didn’t have it earlier)

#### Visual:
- Moodboard
- Inspirations
- Fonts
- Photos
- Patterns
- Mindmap
- Similar case studies

**Tip:** Show the results of your work wisely. Sometimes, your client might become inspired by the existing solutions too early, and they will try to impose a style from an existing project. To avoid this problem, you can use specific slices of typography and UI examples that are separated from the context.

### Presentation
You’re doing this because you care about the client’s business – remember about the importance of presentation. Keep it short and present it like a pro, because time is money. Your professional expertise, your knowledge, and your product design experience determine how you will deliver the client’s product to the world. It’s essential to help the client decide what the best solution is. **Don’t go over 5-15 slides – you can attach other materials to an e-mail, for example.**

## 創意發想與確立概念需要花多少時間？
UX研究是製作成功產品的核心。你需要深入的探索以暸解使用者的行為、思考方式、心智模型以及你的產品如何巴著使用者達成他們的需求。UX研究的方法有很多種，但不論你采用什麼方法，最終都會有利於你的產品。促使洞察更具同理能力(Gaining insights evokes empathy), 創造出有意義且以人為本的解決方案。

**在專案開始之際，想想下面的幾個問題：**
- 是從既有的初稿發展，還是從有到無的設計？
- 能不能在不接觸使用者的狀況下取得可供分析的資料？
- 有沒有辦法接觸到該產品的潛在或真實使用者？

{% include image.html img="user-research-methods.png" alt="User research methods chart" %}
Source: [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods){:target="_blank"}


使用者調查需要的時間取決於你所採用的方法 ─ 訪談使用者時間與後續資料分析需時成正比。然而花費在使用者調查的心力，最終會在產品製作後期展現其成效。你花越多時間去了解使用者，就可以避免有天要迫於猜測使用者行為。使用者調查會讓你更容易以使用者的立場思考！


方法包含以下幾種：
- 使用者測試
- 市場調查
- 問券調查
- 點擊流/熱點圖分析
- 分析研究
- A/B 測試 (A/B testing) 
- 標竿分析法/基準化分析 (Benchmarking)

## 客戶可能會提的問題
{% include qa.html question="為什麼要把設計的時間拿去做研究調查？" answer="完善的發想是優異設計的基石。好的發想會讓你省下往後反覆修改的錢，且讓設計師能夠設計出真正切合市場與使用者的真實需求" %}

{% include qa.html question="需要花多少時間？" answer="我們會盡所能提出最完善的分析，所以確實會花一點時間。取決於策略階段所得到的資訊，我們會提出一份最接近的該產品真實市場與用戶的報告" %}

{% include qa.html question="概念發想會得出什麼結論？" answer="這個階段的成果會是一個簡短版本的分析報告，節錄該產品目標客層、客戶目標、需求以及競爭者的資訊。客戶也會得到一份圖像呈現的慨念，可能是：情緒版(moodboard)、靈感參考、圖片、心智圖等..." %}

{% include qa.html question="我們不知道這麼多！真的有必要繼續這個計畫嗎？" answer="這就是發想階段重要的原因：更加了解你的產品以及環境條件！在這個階段的產出會是往後產品發展的重要基礎。" %}

#### 在本階段問問自己：
- 是否包含所有必需的研究？
- 核心概念是否獲得定義？
- 我是否了解該產品與其特點？
- 我是否了解該產品的商業目標？
- 目標客群是被定義？
- 做過競爭者分析了嗎？
- 使用者目標有沒有定義？

## Desired outcomes of this stage
- You have a set of possible solutions that go beyond the most obvious ones, increasing the chances for real innovation.
- You have understood the results of the research and strategy analysis and created a solid concept.
- Your design ideas are supported and aligned with the research outcomes.
- You conducted the ideation and concept phase and presented the results to the client.
